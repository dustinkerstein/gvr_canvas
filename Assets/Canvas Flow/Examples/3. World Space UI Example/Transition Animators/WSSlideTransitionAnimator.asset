  description: 'The slide transition animation presents content by sliding it in from
    an off-screen location. It dismisses content by performing the reverse - sliding
    it to an off-screen location.


    In addition to the presented canvas controller, the presenting canvas controller
    can also be animated to and from an off-screen location. This gives the appearance
    of the content sliding out as the presented content slides in.


    With the ''presentingCanvasParallaxScalar'' property, you can scale the amount
    by which the presenter moves, creating parallax effects. A value of 1 will animate
    fully to the off-screen location (no parallax), whilst 0.5 would animate halfway
    to the off-screen location.A value of 0 has the same effect as disabling ''animatePresentingCanvas''.'
